  <h1 style="width: 50%; align-items: center; justify-content: center;">EZ-Probate Case Study</h1>
  <div class="empty-div"></div>
</div>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Overview</h2>
  <div class="casewrap">
<br>
  <p><br>Most people have never heard of probate until they need it. Unfortunately,
    this usually coincides with the death of a loved one. EZ-Probate empowers clients
    to complete the probate process quickly and with minimal cost. They style themselves the
    Turbo Tax of the Probate process. Our goal was to improve the usability of EZ-Probate.
    My team started this project by meeting with our stakeholder, Byron Batres.
    From the first meeting, we were all struck by EZ-Probate's unique business model.
    Why EZ-Probate? Most people assume probate requires an attorney.
    Attorneys charge heinous prices because of this assumption. Byron's background is
    in financial planning. This allows him to streamline the probate process for his users
    and keep costs low. </p>
  </div>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Problem</h2>
<div class="casewrap">
  <p>Byron is busy running a business and doesn’t have time to optimize conversions.
    Through Google Analytics and survey data, we determined the bounce point. A few factors cause bouncing:
<br>
• The initial questionnaire and account sign-up is lengthy.
At the end, there isn’t a clear path forward.
<br>
• Some customers were unsure of the legitimacy of this process.
They assumed they would need an attorney to complete probate.
We had to overcome their lack of trust and build confidence in EZ-Probate as a company.
<br>
• Sorting customers into the appropriate service category is important.
For tech-savvy low-impact customers, the cheapest DIY option is ideal.
The concierge service is a better option for customers that need help over the phone.
 task we faced was to enable customers to choose the right path based on our recommendation. </p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Users & Audience</h2>

<div class="casewrap">
  <p>At our first meeting, Byron clearly described his ideal customer. I learned
  who they were, how they acted, and why they chose EZ-Probate. We combed through
Google Analytics, surveys, phone call data, and a report from a business grad.
I was grateful for my Google Analytics certification to make sense of the data.
From this data, we created proto-personas of EZ-Probate's customers. They are female,
 aged 65, and newly widowed. Oftentimes the difficulty our users face is a lack of
tech familiarity. This means they may give up on the service. Also problematic,
they may need more attention than their service tier dictates.</p>
</div>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Roles & Responsibilities</h2>
<div class="casewrap">
  <p>
The UX Design team consisted of Nate Ginsbury, Brook Martenis, and me, Alex Holder.
This project was the capstone of Burlington Code Academy’s UX Design program. Because
 of this, our roles were dynamic. I managed communication with stakeholders. I
 assumed the product manager role with the Jira backlog, ordering priorities. I
 designed and prototyped the mock-ups. I also created the customer survey that
 informed our efforts. During our weekly status call with Byron, I presented our work.
  </p>
</div>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Scope & Constraints</h2>
<div class="casewrap">
  <p>
The scope of our work started out open-ended. We had a time limit of 2 months to
complete the project, with much of that time taken up by other UX Bootcamp tasks.
Once we defined our problem and pain points, we limited our scope to customer touch
points. First, the customer created an account and completed a lengthy questionnaire.
At the end of the questionnaire, there wasn’t a natural pivot to paying for the service.
Because of this, we decided to limit our scope to redesigning this process.
  </p>
</div>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Process & Actions</h2>
  <img style="box-shadow: 0px 1px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.35);

<div class="casewrap">
  <p>
After our initial consultation with Byron, we did a card sort exercise. This
helped us organize our thoughts and impressions. Out of this exercise, we constructed
a ‘How Might We’ statement. This reframes problems as opportunities. We asked
ourselves, “How might we digitally hold the customer’s hand throughout this process
and make them feel more comfortable with it?”.

The second thing we did was comb through the data. We had EZ-Probate’s Pipedrive,
Aircall, Google Analytics, survey results, and more. From this we were able to
construct two user personas. Our first persona, Doris, was the less tech-savvy of
the two. Doris would be ideal for the Concierge service.

The second persona, Susan, was younger and had a better grip on using her computer.
Susan would be well-suited to use the less expensive, DIY option. While redesigning
EZ-Probate’s process, we empathized with how our personas would feel. We wanted
to make it as easy as possible for Doris and Susan to meet their goals. With our
personas in mind, we conducted a heuristics survey of the usability of EZ-Probate.
We used Jakob Nielsen’s 10 usability heuristics. We laid out the process in
chronological screenshots. Brook took this opportunity to construct a user journey
map. Our personas’ journey gave us psychographic data. We asked how they feel and
what actions they take at each stage of the user journey.

Meanwhile, Nate drew up a few flow charts to help us better understand how we could improve
the process.

We expanded our scope beyond EZ-Probate and did a comparative assessment of Turbo
Tax. Turbo Tax is similar in that it takes a convoluted process and makes it easy
to get through.

At this point, we started drawing up lo-fi wireframes. We discussed what we liked
about the current process and what to improve. We identified what other companies
did well.

One of the first themes to emerge was compression. We knew we wanted to speed up
the process for our users and convert them earlier. To do this we needed to gain
their confidence.

We broke the questionnaire into two sections.

The first section is a short screener to make sure their case was appropriate for our services.
It rates three things:

• the complexity of the case
• their technical prowess
• their attitude towards probate.

Based on these things, we recommend 1 of 3 service tiers.

At this point, the customer we encourage to check out to continue the process. The
benefit here is that we let people know early on if we can help. Before, when customers
weren't eligible for the service, they became frustrated. They had already completed
the long questionnaire and created an account.

To increase buy-in, we also included this inspiring video at the beginning of the screener.</p>

  </div>

<p> From this point, we iterated. Many times.

Brook managed the style guide to ensure everyone stayed
consistent. We updated components, colors, typography, and spacing until we found
a good fit.

One example of increasing usability was switching from
radio buttons to clickable cards. {insert before/ after}

We made sure to consider accessibility when it came to our palette and font-sizes.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Outcomes & What I Learned</h2>

<div class="casewrap">
  <p>
This was my first complete UX Design project. I learned a lot from this experience.
If I could go back to the beginning of this process, I would approach Figma differently.
I would rely more on components to save time and be able to update every instance
with a few clicks. I would have paid attention to alignment and spacing more in our
lo-fi wireframes. This would have save d time towards the end. We used a grid, but
our alignment issues came from small components that were not consistent. It's
difficult to manage consistency when teammates are working on different concepts
simultaneously. I was extremely lucky to have Brook and Nate as teammates. I
learned a lot from them. Nate has a project management background, which added
value to our work. Brook was the style guide manager, an unenviable task but one
at which she excelled. From our client, we learned how to take feedback and present
our work to a non-UX audience. Byron was great to work with. Any value we can add
to EZ-Probate he completely deserves. At this point, we will hand off our deliverables
at the end of next week. I will be sure to update this with our design outcomes
as soon as they become available.

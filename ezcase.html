  <p><br>Most people have never heard of probate until they need it. Unfortunately, this
  usually coincides with the death of a loved one. EZ-Probate's mission is to empower clients
  to go through the probate process quickly and with minimal cost. They style themselves the Turbo
  Tax of the Probate process. Our goal was to improve the usability of EZ-Probate.
  My team started this project by meeting <br><br><br><br>with our stakeholder, Byron Batres.
  From the first meeting, we were all struck by EZ-Probate's unique business model.
  Why EZ-Probate? Most people assume probate requires an attorney. Attorneys charge
  heinous prices because of this assumption. Byron's background is in financial planning.
  This allows him to streamline the probate process for his users and keep costs low.</p>
  </div>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Problem</h2>
<div class="casewrap">
  <p>Byron is focused on delivering perfect results for each of his customers. This leaves
    little time to envision redesigning his site or optimizing conversions. Through
    Google Analytics and survey data, we determined exactly where we users bounced from the process.
    This bouncing is caused by a few factors. First is the process itself. The initial
    questionnaire and account sign-up can be lengthy and at the end, there isn’t a clear path forward.
    Secondly, some customers were unsure of the legitimacy of this process. They assumed
    they would need an attorney <br><br>to complete probate. For these customers, we had to overcome
    their lack of trust and build confidence in EZ-Probate as a company. The third problem
    involves sorting customers into the appropriate service category. For tech-savvy low-impact
    customers, the cheapest DIY option is ideal. For customers that
  require constant assistance over the phone, the concierge service is a better option.
  The task we faced was to enable customers to choose the right path based on our recommendation.</p>

  <p>At our first meeting, Byron laid out the groundwork for our project. He was
  able to clearly describe his ideal customer. I learned who they were, how they acted,
and why they chose EZ-Probate. We were lucky in that Byron gave us the keys to the kingdom.
We had access to all his data. We combed through Google Analytics, surveys, phone call data,
and a report from a business grad. At this point, I was <br><br><br>grateful for my Google Analytics certification. From this data, we started by creating
proto-personas of EZ-Probate's customers. They are female, aged 65, and newly widowed. Oftentimes the difficulty our users face is a lack of tech familiarity. This means they may
give up on the service or simply require too much hand-holding for the automated, less expensive DIY option.</p>
</div>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Roles & Responsibilities</h2>
<div class="casewrap">
  <p>
The UX Design team consisted of Nate Ginsbury, Brook Martenis, and me, Alex Holder. This project
was the capstone of Burlington Code Academy’s UX Design program. Because of this,
our roles were dynamic. I spent a lot of time in communication with <br><br><br>stakeholders,
managing the Jira backlog, directing priorities, designing, and prototyping the mock-ups.
I also created the customer survey that informed our efforts. During our weekly status call
with Byron, I presented our work.

  </p>
</div>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Scope & Constraints</h2>
<div class="casewrap">
  <p>
The scope of our work started out open-ended. We were constrained by a time limit
of 2 months to complete the project, with much of that time being taken up by other
UX Bootcamp tasks. Once we defined our problem and identified pain points, we limited
our scope to redesigning customer touchpoints around the bottleneck I’ll <br><br><br>describe next.
When a customer arrived at EZ-Probate, the service started with having the customer
create an account and fill out a lengthy questionnaire. At the end of the questionnaire,
there wasn’t a natural pivot to paying for the service. Because of this, we decided
to limit our scope to redesigning this process.
  </p>
</div>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Process & Actions</h2>

<div class="casewrap">
  <p>
After our initial consultation with Byron, we did a card sort exercise. This helped
us organize our thoughts and impressions. Out of this exercise, we constructed a
‘How Might We’ statement. This reframes problems as opportunities. We asked ourselves,
“How might we digitally hold the customer’s hand throughout this process and make
them feel more comfortable with it?”. The second thing we did was comb through the
data. We had access to EZ-Probate’s Pipedrive, Aircall, Google Analytics, survey
results, and more. From this we were able to construct two user personas. Our first
persona, Doris, was the less tech-savvy of the two. Doris would be ideal for the
Concierge service. The second persona, Susan, was slightly younger and had a better
grip on using her computer. Susan would be well-suited to use the less expensive,
DIY option. While redesigning EZ-Probate’s process, we empathized with how our
personas would feel. We wanted to make it as easy as possible for Doris and Susan
to accomplish their goals. With our personas in mind, we conducted a heuristics
survey of the usability of EZ-Probate. We relied on Jakob Nielsen’s 10 usability
heuristics to understand the current state of the process. We laid out the process
in chronological screenshots. Brook took this opportunity to construct a user
journey map. Our personas’ journey gave us psychographic data.We asked how they
feel and what actions they take at each stage of the user journey. Meanwhile,
Nate drew up a few flow charts to help us better understand how we could improve
the process. We expanded our scope beyond EZ-Probate and did a comparative assessment
of Turbo Tax. Unlike a competitive assessment, a comparative assessment looks not
at direct competitors but at products and <br><br><br>services your customers are likely to
encounter and use. Turbo Tax is similar in that it takes a convoluted process and
makes it easy to get through. At this point, we started drawing up lo-fi wireframes.
We discussed what we liked about the current process and what we thought could be
modified. We were influenced by our comparative analysis and identified what other
companies did well. One of the early themes to emerge was compression. We knew
we wanted to speed up the process for our users and convert them earlier. To do
this would require gaining their confidence. We broke the questionnaire into two
sections. The first section would be a short screener to make sure their case was
appropriate for our services. We would gauge the complexity of the case, their
technical prowess, along with their attitude towards probate. Based on these
things, we would recommend 1 of 3 service tiers. At this point, the customer would
be encouraged to check out to continue the process. The benefit here is that we
let people know early on if we can help. There was frustration before when customers
completed the long questionnaire and created an account only to find out that their
case wasn’t appropriate for EZ-Probate. To increase buy-in, we also included an
inspiring video of the founder at the beginning of the screener. From this point,
we iterated. Many times. Brook managed the style guide to ensure everyone stayed
consistent. We updated components, colors, typography, and spacing until we found
a good fit. One example of increasing usability of components was the switch from
radio buttons to clickable cards. {insert before/ after} We made sure to consider
accessibility when it came to our palette and font-sizes.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Outcomes & What I Learned</h2>

<div class="casewrap">
  <p>
This was my first complete UX Design project. I learned a lot from this experience.
If I could go back to the beginning of this process, I would approach Figma differently.
I would rely more on components to save time and be able to update every instance with a
few clicks. I would have paid attention to alignment and spacing more at the beginning
of our lo-fi wireframes to save us time towards the end. We used a grid but our alignment
issues came from small components not being precise form frame to frame. It can be
difficult to manage consistency when teammates are working on different concepts
simultaneously. I was <br><br>extremely lucky to have Brook and Nate as teammates. I learned a lot
from them. Nate has a project management background which added value to our work.
Brook was the style guide manager, an unenviable task but one at which she excelled.
From our client, we learned how to take feedback and present our work to a non-UX audience.
Byron was great to work with. Any value we are able to add to EZ-Probate he completely
deserves. At this point, we will hand off our deliverables at the end of next week.
I will be sure to update this with the outcomes of our design as soon as they become available.

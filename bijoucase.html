<h2 style="text-align: center;">Overview</h2>
  <div class="casewrapb">
<br>
  <p>
    Bijou for You was the result of a Le Wagon Montréal project. My team was tasked with
    building an Airbnb-style rental platform using Ruby on Rails, HTML, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, & CSS.
    Although the website works, the listings aren't currently available for rental.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Problem</h2>
<div class="casewrapb">
  <p>
    Modern fashionistas enjoy putting on the Ritz for the right occasion but this can
    get quite expensive. For jewelry, it doesn't make sense to invest a large amount
    of money in pieces that are rarely worn. Instead, rent from our trusted community
    of high-end jewelry owners.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Users & Audience</h2>
<div class="casewrapb">
  <p>
    Our user persona is a 30-something female who gets invited to 6 or more weddings a year.
    Her social calendar is busy but funds are tight. She is tech-savvy and well-connected.
  </p>
</div>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Roles & Responsibilities</h2>
<div class="casewrapb">
  <p>
    I worked on the front-end development for this project.
  </p>
</div>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Scope & Constraints</h2>
<div class="casewrapb">
  <p>
    This project was time-boxed to one week. We needed to have a working MVP in time
    to present to our coding colleagues.
  </p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Outcomes & What I Learned</h2>
<div class="casewrapb">
  <p>
    This project was instrumental in learning front-end development. It forced me to tinker
    with < div's > until I got everything right. Fighting flex-boxes? You betcha.
